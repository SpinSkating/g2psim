V1.2 By Jixie Zhang @ 20121105
  Added Min's 5T longitudial target field + septum 400016 left arm snake model.


V1.1 By Jixie Zhang @ 20121008

John provided a new snake model for 3cm raster, 5.65 deg and with 484816+shim septum. 
I added this model into HRSTransport and renamed several files in that dir.

The result shows that this version have better resolution on each variables, expecially in
Ytr.

V1.0  By Jixie Zhang @ 20120918

This project was developed to test the snake transportation packages, which 
should be provided by either John ReLose or Min Huang. It was upgraded later  
to test the dependence on BPM resolution.

This project can thrown x_tr,y_tr,theta_tr,phi_tr and delta randomly in 3 distributions:
delta, flat and gaussian. One can select the distribution by choose the 4th argument 
'iSourceDistr' as 0, 1, and 2. The width of these 5 variables (x_tr, y_tr, theta_tr, 
phi_tr and delta) are: 0.012,0.012,0.070,0.035 and 0.05, respectively. 
When iSourceDistr=2, the sigma of the these 5 variables are one half of the above values.

The 3rd argument of this program,'iSmearX0', was used to test how the BPM resolution 
affect the reconstruction resolution. Here is the detail of this argument:
If iSmearX0=0, the Xtg_BMP_tr will also set to zero;
If iSmearX0=1, no smearing on Xtg_BMP_tr; 
If iSmearX0=2, 1 mm gaussian smearing to Xtg_BMP_tr; 
If iSmearX0=3, 10 BPM resolution, from 0 to 2.5 mm with step of 0.25mm, will be 
used to smear the Xtg_BMP_tr; 

The 2nd argument, 'iExperiment', is used to tell which snake model will be tested.
iExperiment==[10,20) is for g2p, 20 for E97110 GDH iExperiment
//Here is a list of experiment candidates:
//experiment=10: g2p septum without shim, 5.65 deg, Created by John, use this for g2p test run
//experiment=11: g2p septum 484816+shim, 5.65 deg, Created by Min, 
//experiment=12: g2p septum 403216+shim, 5.65 deg, SNAKE Model not ready yet 
//experiment=13: g2p septum 400016+shim, 5.65 deg, SNAKE Model not ready yet 
//experiment=19: g2p septum 403216+shim, 5.65 deg, Min's version for normal septum without shim
//experiment=20: GDH exp with large X0 version
//experiment=all other values: Standard HRS seting, no septum field, no target field

The output of this program will be a ntuple and some graph plot based on it.

Usage: ./ts.Darwin.i386.exe <iNEvent> <iExperiment(=10|11|12|13|19|20)> <iSmearX0(=0|1|2)> 
	 [iSourceDistr=1(0|1|2)] [iArm=0(0|1|2)] 

	 10<=iExperiment<20 is for g2p|gep experiment, iExperiment=20 for GDH experiment
	 iExperiment=10,11,12,13 are for normal 484816 septa, 484816+shim,403216+shim,400016+shim
	 iSmearX0=0,1,2 means X0=0, X0=X0_BPM, X0=gaussian_smeared_X0_BMP
	 iSourceDistr=0,1,2 means delta,flat, gaussian distribution for x,theta,y,phi,delta
	 iArm = 0,1,2 means random, left arm, right arm

example:
./ts.Darwin.i386.exe 10000 11 1 1 1

./ts.Darwin.i386.exe 10000 11 2 1 1

./ts.Darwin.i386.exe 10000 11 3 1 1

./ts.Darwin.i386.exe 10000 11 2 1 2




Conclusion from the tested results:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

dTheta_tr/dSigma_BPM = 0.38

4) Ytg reconstruction turns bad when abs(Ytg_tr)>10mm
We just do not have any way to make the correction.
