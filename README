Usage:

    Run.C could be used to debug and test. This root script use the shared library directly with ROOT support.
    Once finished debug, the script could be copied into Main.cc and be compiled to an executable to increase the speed.
    Main.cc is written with supports of a simple set of commandline parameters as well as a fully functional configure file. Use it as a template to generate your own executable.
