Author: Chao Gu, Min Huang, Jie Liu, Jixie Zhang

Release version: 1.7.1
HRSTrans version: 1.3.2
G2PPhys version: 1.5.0

Usage:
    Run.C could be used to debug and test. This root script use the shared library directly with ROOT support.
    Main.cc is written with supports of a simple set of commandline parameters as well as a fully functional configure file.
